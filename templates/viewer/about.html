  <h5 class="title-center">This is a curated backup of tagged galleries from several sources that have been/could be removed from their original source.</h5>
  <h5 class="title-center">It is not meant to be an online viewer, the only focus is gathering and saving removed galleries.</h5>
  <h5 class="title-center">Might also include other galleries for the sake of having tags for them.</h5>
  <h5 class="title-center">Only English and RAW (Japanese). Mainly magazines, doujinshi, anthologies, CG sets. Not for cosplay, JAV, or other stuff.</h5>
