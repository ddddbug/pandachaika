TODO: Store the queue temporally on the database to prevent queue loss on restarts.
TODO: Matchers should check if the gallery encountered at first is present locally first, and get their metadata from there, and only after that, get their metadata remotely.
TODO: Matchers right now call each provider directly, they don't go through the queue, which is not the ideal method, since we could possibly go over the limit for each provider.
TODO: Matchers should queue the URL (as _info), then fetch the metadata from the database.
TODO: Separate queues for each provider.
TODO: Change remotesite format, send metadata directly, don't send links to crawl and allow other providers. Do this by exposing InternalParser.
TODO: Each provider should have its own schedule in auto_wanted.
TODO: Improve the preload login, prioritize next images over last ones, single queue over parallel.
TODO: COL: Enable web matcher.

TODO: We process every link in parsers before passing every resulting GalleryData to the downloaders. The better way should be to pass to asynchronously as soon as one batch request returns.
TODO: Rework threads running internally to use an external background handler.

TODO: auto_search runs using 1 scheduler per provider. It would be better to allow running separate schedules depending on the feed_url being used. Some feed-like pages are updated more frequently.
TODO: Accept without downloading SubmitEntries that are added outside the submit cycle, problably using a signal after a file is saved, since it could be an uploaded file that just got linked to a gallery.

TODO: Option to precalculate img hash (perceptual) to compare when matching archives with gallery templates. Could be a generic img hash table, that could link to Archive, or Gallery.
TODO: Refactor twitter provider, to allow more easily to plugin other handles, like: @wani_kairakuten

TODO: Add warning when binning Archive that is public.
